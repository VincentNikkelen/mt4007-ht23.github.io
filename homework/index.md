# Homework

The homework portion of this course consists of 6 assigments, each paired with
peer-review of a fellow students homework. Both the assignment and the
peer-review has to be finished to pass the homework.    The deadlines for both the assignments and
peer-review are strict. If you do not manage to submit the homework in time you
will need to do extra work.

## Assigment 

The assigment will consists of a few tasks that test you on the material we have
done in the previous weeks. The homework will be available on the solve date,
that is when we have gone through the relevant material for the assignment. They
will get more difficult throughout the course. Report the solutions to the tasks
in form of a blogpost with clear explanations and documentation of the
procedure, **not as bulletpoints**.

The homework is submitted to the github organisation under your own repository.
When you are finished *raise an issue*, otherwise we will not grade your
assignment.

## Peer Review

The peer-review will be made **available every monday before 12:00**, following
the submission of the assigment. The peer-review consists of analysing a fellow
students solutions to the assigment. Give feedback on the solutions and the
report as a whole. After the assigment hand-in you will have access to another
students repo on the github organisation, this is the project you are going to
review. You will give your feedback under the issue that has been raised. **Do
not close the issue**.

**The deadline for the peer-review is on wednesday at 23:59.**
