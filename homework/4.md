## Data Preparation

we are working we 3 datasets

- cellphone data 
- population data 
- country data 

to begin with the task is to clean the cell phones data. We can do this by
analysing the dataset and interpretting the characters. The goal is to fill in
some nans and discard others. When this dataset is clean enough, I want them to
document what they have done and how they cleaned it. Show top 5 countries over
some of the specific years.


Now it is time to look at the how the population affects the number of phones.
A metric of how well a country is doing can be viewed using the number of phones
per capita. To be able to calculate this, one needs to pivot and merge tables.
Three tables above to be specific.
