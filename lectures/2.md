## Summary
In this lecture, we are going to dive deeper into Git, introducing conepts such
as branching and forking.

We will also start looking at how to work with data using dataframes and how to
perform simple operations on them to manipulate the data to our liking. We will
look at how to *sort*, *select*, *filter* and *mutate*.

## Git
In the [previous lecture](/lectures/1), we talked about some of the basic concepts of Git
such as commiting, pushing, creating a repository and so on, these concepts are sufficient 
to use Git. However, to harness the full capabilities of Git we need a few more concepts. 

### .gitignore
As you might have already seen, when working on project, there are a lot of
unnecessary files that enter the project. For instance, if you use jupyter notebooks, a file named 
`.ipynb_checkpoints` will be generated automatically.
In most cases, tracking these types of files and/or folders with Git is not needed. To ignore these
particular files and/or folders we can use `.gitignore`. The `.gitignore` file is an index for all the
files and folders you do not wish to track.  

A simple example of a `.gitignore` file, in our case, can be
```
.ipynb_checkpoints
```
Sometimes it is typical to also ignore the `.gitignore` file. It depends on the project. You can ignore as many file and folders you
deem unnecessary to track.

You can create this file manually, or using Github desktop. Using Github
desktop, in the menu bar, go to `Repository> Repository Settings > Ignored Files`
and add the files and folders you wish to ignore there. If you create it
manually, make sure to place the `.gitignore` file in the root of you
repository.

### Forking vs Cloning
Forking, is concept that is central to Git. Forking is an action done on a Git
repository, which makes a copy of a repo and makes you the owner. In contrast,
when you clone a repository, you make a copy, but the copy is still linked to
the original repository. 

#### When should I fork a repository?
When you want to make changes to a project that you do not have ownership of.
Or, if you want to make your own version of the project and build from the original
project, you can fork the repository. Be mindfull of the rights you have to
the code. If the project is open-source, there is no issue with forking the
code. However, if this is not the case, it is theft of intellectual property. 

There are many popular projects that are forks. For instance, most of the linux
distros are forks of an older distriubtion. For instance, **Linux Mint** is forked
from Ubuntu.

#### When should i clone a repository?
When you want to make changes to a repository that that you have ownership of
and you want the changes to be reflected in the original repository, then you
can clone the repository. 

Cloning is something you have already done, when you set up your repository on
the course organization.

Although, forking and cloning seem similar, there are small but important
differences between them. 

Forking is also very popular when making contributions to open-source
projects. Read more about forking [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).

### Branches
During development, you will most likely encouter a situation where you would
like to make changes to your code. Imagine you would like to add a new feature
to your code, for instance, too add a completely new functionality to your
software. Since you are in development stages, you don't want to ruin the
original working code in case you decide the feature dosen't work as intended,
so you might be urgred to make a copy and develop your new feature on the copied code.
Git, defines this procedure as branching. The idea is that you "branch" of from your main
code to develop the feature. If you decide that the feature was a bad idea, you
can just delete the branch and jump to your main branch without changes being
made to your main code. On the other hand, if you decide that the features is
good, you can `merge` the new feature to you main branch. Using the branching
procedure, you can develop several features conccurently and independently. The
following illustration will make this more clear.

image from: [the turing way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/vcs/vcs-git-branches.html).

This image illustrates how the process of branching may look in a project. As
you can see, two features can be developed concurrently without conflics.
This makes developing features easier. It also makes it easier to collaborate
with others.

You may have noticed that you are working on the `main` branch of your
repository. This is the default. You can simply create a new branch whenever you
feel like you want to add a feature to your code and don't want to ruin the
original code. This is usually not an issue for very small projects. However, as
your project grows, branching becomes very important.

#### How to create a Git branch

It is very simple to create and merge/delete a branch. On Github Desktop, press
on the `Current Branch` tab and then select new branch. Name it something that makes
sense to the feature you are going to add. Finally, choose the branch
you want base the new branch on, that is, the istance of your code that you want
to branch of from. Note that this only creates a local branch and
you need to `Publish` the new branch if you want it to be seen on Github. 

#### How to merge/delete a branch

On Github desktop, under the `Current branch` tab you will see all the branches of your (local)
repository. To delete a branch, simply right click on the branch and select
`delete`. To merge a branch, under the `Current branch` drop down, there is a
tab called `Pull Requests`, open this tab and in the bottom press the button,
`Chosse a branch to merge into ...`. Finally, chose the branch you want to merge
and press `Create merge commit`. 

If you feature branch is published on Github, you can do on there as well. Read
more about how to do that [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

## DataFrames
Tables are the goto structure to visualize data, which consis of columns and rows, 
A popular (and good) way of organizing data in tables is using columns e.g. Name, Age, Height, to represent
variables and rows to represent entries.

A dataset might look like this

| Name                | Age | Height(cm) | Occupation | Id |
|---------------------|-----|------------|------------|----|
| Taariq Nazar        | 26  | 187        | Phd        | 0  |
| Someone Cooler      | 27  | 188        | Proffesor  | 1  |
| Someone Even Cooler | 28  | 189        | Emeritus   | 2  |
| Someone so cool     | 26  | 179        | Plumber    | 3  |

A table format of the dataset is called a `Dataframe`. In this case, the data
consists of three entries and 4(5) variables (one does not usually count the row
number (Id) as a variable unless it is crucial part of the dataset e.g. a
special id specific to the data). A core concept of this course is how to work
with dataframes, that is, how to perform operations on dataframes. We will learn to work
with simple questions such as, *how many people are taller than 180 cm?*.

### Working with Dataframes
There a set of basic operations you should be familiar with to work on
dataframes. For instance, you might want to order the entries by age. This is called `sorting`.
You might not necessarily need all the variables of the data and only need a few
of them, choosing the variables you are interesting in is called `selecting`.
You might only want to look at your data where variable only takes
on a single value, this is called `filtering`. Finally, you might need to add more
variables, or transform already existing data. This is called `mutating`. There
are many more operations we will learn, but we will begin by learning how to perform these basic but powerful operations.

The syntax for performing these operations on dataframes looks as follows
:::code-group
```Python
import pandas as pd

# The standard library for datframes in Python is Pandas
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Sorting 
#Set ascending False if the order you want is descending.
df.sort_values(column_name, ascending=True) 

# Selecting 
df.loc[[column_name1, column_name2,... ]] #Choose the columns of interest. 

# Filtering 
#Condition of your filter, for instance condition = df["age"]>=10 && df["age"]<20.
df.loc[condition] 

# Mutating 
# Using lambda-functions makes it easy to transform. You can also you regular functions.
df[new_col] = df.loc[[cols_to_mutate]].transform(lambda x: x[col_1]/x[col_2])
```

```R 
#In R, the operations is packaged into the `dplyr` library. The pipe operator %>%`, makes operating on dataframes very easy.
library(dplyr)

df = tibble(data)

# Sorting
#Change column_name -> descending(column_name) if you want it to be descending.
df %>% arrange(column_name, .by_group = FALSE) 

# Selecting 
# You can build complex selection methods using select(), e.g. criterion = column_name
df %>% select(criterion) 

# Filtering 
# Bulding complex filters is very simple, for instance criterion: age>=mean(age)
df %>% filter(crtierion)

# Mutating
# You can mutate the current df by using mutate()
df %>% mutate(new_col = f(column_variables))

# Due to pipes, one can compose operations in a simple manner.
# Example of composing
df %>%
  select(column_1, column_5, column_2) %>%
  arrange(column_2, .by_group=FALSE) %>%
  filter(column_5 >= 10) %>%
  mutate(column_99 = column_1/column_5 * column_2. .keep="all")
```
:::

You can combine these simple operations to compose very complex ones. To find
the documentation, google "package method doucmentation". E.g.
"pandas loc documentation", the first link is usually the original
documentation. The doucmentation will contain indepth information for the
specific method you are using.
