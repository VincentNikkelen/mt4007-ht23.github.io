## Summary
In this lecture, we are going to dive deeper into Git, introducing conepts such
as branching and forking.

We will also start looking at how to work with data using dataframes and how to
perform simple operations on them to manipulate the data to our liking. We will
look at how to *sort*, *select*, *filter* and *mutate*.

## Git
In the [previous lecture](/lecture/1), we talked about some basic topics of Git
such as commiting, pushing, creating a repository and so on. ( Add some more on
what has been prior). This is sufficient to be able to use Git. However, having an understanding 
of few more core concepts will increase your capabilities and taking your
Git-ting another level. 

### .gitignore
As you might have already seen, when you are developing you will see many
unnecessary files that pop-up, which are a part of the underlying development
program. For instance, if you use jupyter notebooks, a file named `.ipynb_checkpoints` will be generated automatically.
In most cases, tracking the folder with Git is not needed. To ignore, this
particular folder we can use `.gitignore`, which is a file you can create
in the root of your (local) repository, that specifies all the files and folders that you do not want
to track with Git. 

A baCont. Git & Introduction to Dataframes example of a `.gitignore` file, in our case, can be
```python
.gitignore
.ipynb_checkpoints
```
It is typical to also ignore the `.gitignore` file. You can ignore as many file and folders you
deem unnecessary to track.

You can create this file manually, or using Github desktop. Using Github
desktop, in the menu bar, go to `Repository> Repository Settings > Ignored Files`
and add the files and folders you wish to ignore there.

### Forking vs Cloning
Forking, is concept that is central to Git. Forking is an action done on a Git
repository, which makes a copy of a repo but that is owned by you. In contrast,
when you clone a repository, you make a copy, but the copy is still linked to
the original process. 

**When should I fork a repository?**
When you want to make changes to a project that you do not have ownership of,
that is, you do not own the git repo, you should fork the repository. Or, if you
want to make your own version of the project and build from the original
project, you should fork the repository. Be mindfull of the rights you have to
the code. If the project is open-source, there is no issue with forking the
code. However, if this is not the case, it is theft of intellectual property. 
When you fork a repository, the project is not linked to the original repo.

**When should i clone a repository??**

When you want to make changes to a repository that that you have ownership of
and you want the changes to be reflected in the original repository.

This course website is a fork of a [Github repository](https://github.com/miracleonyenma/content-v2-blog), the link can also be found in the footer of 
the course webpage. I am also mindfull to give credit to the original creator of
the template.

Cloning is something you have already done, when you set up your repository on
the course organization.

Forking is also very popular when making contributions to open-source
projects. Read more about forking [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).

### Branches
In many situations you may want to add a new feature to your code,
for instance, too add a completely new functionality to your program or
to change your entire parts of your code. You typically also, don't want to ruin the
original code since you are still in development stages, so you might be urgred
to make a copy and develop your new feature on the copied code. Git, defines
this procedure as branching. The idea is that you "branch" of from your main
code to develop the feature. If you decide that the feature was a bad idea, you
can just delete the branch and jump to your main branch without changes being
made to your main code. On the other hand, if you decide that the features is
good, you can `merge` the new feature to you main branch. Using the branching
procedure, you can develop several features conccurently and independently. The
following illustration will make this more clear.

image from: [the turing way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/vcs/vcs-git-branches.html).


This image illustrates how the process of branching may look in a project. As
you can see, to features are being developed without the hindrance of the other.
This makes developing features easier. It also makes it easier to collaborate
with others.

You may have noticed that you are working on the `main` branch of your
repository. This is the default. You can simply create a new branch whenever you
feel like you want to add a feature to your code and don't want to ruin the
original code. This is usually not an issue for very small projects. However, as
your project grows, branching becomes very important.

**How do you create a branch**

It is very simple to create and merge/delete a branch. On Github Desktop, press
on the `Current Branch` tab and then new branch. Name it something that makes
sense to the feature you are going to add. Finally, choose which original branch
you want base the new branch on. Note that this only creates a local branch and
you need to `Publish` the new branch if you want it to be seen in Github. 

**How do you merge/delete a branch**

We can begin by explaining the process of deleting a branch. On Github desktop,
under the `Current branch` tab you will see all the branches of you (local)
repository, to delete a branch, simply right click on the branch and select
`delete`. To merge a branch, under the `Current branch` drop down, there is a
tab called `Pull Requests`, open this tab and in the bottom press the button,
`Chosse a branch to merge into ...`. Finally, chose the branch you want to merge
and press `Create merge commit`.

## DataFrames
When working with data, you have a table, consisting of columns and rows, where,
the columns describe the variables of the data, e.g. Name, Age, Height, etc. The
rows are the entriesm e.g and entry of an individual. A dataset might look like
this

| Name                | Age | Height(cm) | Occupation | Id |
|---------------------|-----|------------|------------|----|
| Taariq Nazar        | 26  | 187        | Phd        | 0  |
| Someone Cooler      | 27  | 188        | Proffesor  | 1  |
| Someone Even Cooler | 28  | 189        | Emeritus   | 2  |
| Someone so cool     | 26  | 188        | Plumber    | 3  |

A table format of the dataset is called a `Dataframe`. In this case, the data
consists of three entries and 4(5) variables. One does not usually count the row
number (Id) as a variable unless it is crucial part of the dataset (e.g. a
special id specific to the data). A core concept of this course is how to work
with dataframes. That is, how to perform operations on the dataframes. Imagine,
you want to group the data above into bins of height and count how many is in each
bin. How can you do this? 

### Working with Dataframes
There a set of basic operations you should be familiar with to work on
dataframes. When working with data frames you often want to reorder the entries, for
instance if you want you data to be arranged by age. This is called `sorting`.
You might not necessarily need all the variables of the data and only need a few
of them, selecting the variables you are interesting in is called `selecting`. In
other times you might only want to look at your data where variable only takes
on a single value, this is called `filtering`. Finally, need to add more
variables, or transform already existing data. This is called `mutating` your
data. We will begin by learning how to perform these basic but powerful operations.

The syntax for performing these operations on dataframes looks as follows
:::code-group
```Python
import pandas as pd

# The standard library for datframes in Python is Pandas
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Sorting 
#Set ascending False if the order you want is descending.
df.sort_values(column_name, ascending=True) 

# Selecting 
df.loc[[column_name1, column_name2,... ]] #Choose the columns of interest. 

# Filtering 
#Condition of your filter, for instance condition = df["age"]>=10 && df["age"]<20.
df.loc[condition] 

# Mutating 
# Using lambda-functions makes it easy to transform. You can also you regular functions.
df[new_col] = df.loc[[cols_to_mutate]].transform(lambda x: x[col_1]/x[col_2])
```

```R 
#In R, the operations is packaged into the `dplyr` library. It is very nice to
#use the pipe operator `%>%`.



library(dplyr)

df = tibble(data)

# Sorting
#Change column_name -> descending(column_name) if you want it to be descending.
df %>% arrange(column_name, .by_group = FALSE) 

# Selecting 
# You can build complex selection methods using select(), e.g. criterion = column_name
df %>% select(criterion) 

# Filtering 
# Bulding complex filters is very simple, for instance criterion: age>=mean(age)
df %>% filter(crtierion)

# Mutating
# You can mutate the current df by using mutate()
df %>% mutate(new_col = f(column_variables))

# Due to pipes, one can compose operations in a simple manner.
# Example of composing
df %>%
  select(column_1, column_5, column_2) %>%
  arrange(column_2, .by_group=FALSE) %>%
  filter(column_5 >= 10) %>%
  mutate(column_99 = column_1/column_5 * column_2. .keep="all")
```
:::

These are very simple ways to do operations of dataframes. However, using these
simple operations you can manipulate the dataframe in very complex ways. You can
always find more complex methods in the documentation for the packages. To find
the documentation, google "". E.g.
"pandas loc documentation", the first link is usually the original
documentation. 

## Exercises
I want to introduce ways of working with these data in concrete ways, using for
instance real data for you to work with.
